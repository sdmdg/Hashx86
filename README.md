# Hashx86 Operating System

**Status**: 🚧 This project is currently under development.

Hashx86 is a minimalistic operating system built for the **x86 architecture**. Designed primarily for educational and experimental purposes, it provides basic functionality and serves as a foundation for exploring OS concepts and low-level system programming.

Simple yet effective, Hashx86 focuses on core features without unnecessary complexity.

## 🔧 About

This project focuses on low-level system development, implementing core operating system functionalities such as:

- Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs)
- Physical Memory Management (PMM)
- Dynamic Kernel Heap (KHeap)
- Direct video memory manipulation (supports both VGA Text and VGA Graphics modes)
- High-resolution graphics rendering via VESA
- Hardware interaction through custom drivers
- Paging
- ELF binary loading and execution
- System call interface for custom binaries
- Multitasking with process and thread management
- Basic event handling
- Widget-based GUI framework
